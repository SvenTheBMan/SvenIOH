                    It may be that you see the use of your image as an infringement on your intellectual property. 
                    I try to get as many images as possible from Unsplash. 
                    All images whose source is Unsplash fall under the <a href="https://unsplash.com/license" target="_blank">Unsplash license</a>. 
                    This means that it is best to first contact Unsplash or remove the photo from Unsplash yourself.

                <p>
                    If I have used your image and it is not on Unsplash? 
                    Please contact me as soon as possible so that I can rectify this.
